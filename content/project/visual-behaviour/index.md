Understanding how pedestrians and cyclists visually experience the built environment can guide how we design our urban infrastructure to make it a safer and more attractive environment for people to walk and cycle in. One example of this is in the context of designing appropriate outdoor lighting. If we know what the important visual tasks of pedestrians and cyclists are, we can design lighting to facilitate these visual tasks when it is dark.

As part of my PhD I carried out a study in which people walked real urban environments outdoors whilst wearing an eye-tracker. An eye-tracker is a piece of equipment that records your eye movements and gaze behaviour, and is able to give detailed information about what you look at in the world around you. I wanted to identify what features of the environment were important for pedestrians to look at. Simply looking at something does not mean it is important to us though. For example, we often do not even direct our attention at the thing our eyes are pointing at. A good example of this is shown by Charbis and Simons' 'Invisible Gorilla' experiment.

Previous research using [eye-tracking with pedestrians] (https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1477153514522472) confirmed that observing the path to look out for potential hazards and obstacles is a critical visual task. Detecting obstacles is harder to do at night due to reduced light levels restricting the visual information we receive. One of the essential purposes of road lighting for pedestrians is therefore to help us see potential obstacles in our path. My PhD and subsequent postdoctoral research looked at the task of detecting obstacles and how lighting influenced this task.

In a laboratory study, I used a physical pedestrian simulator to investigate the effect of illuminance and spectrum on the ability to detect an obstacle. This found that increasing illuminance above 2 lux had little effect on our ability to detect an obstacle. Light with a higher Scotopic / Photopic luminance ratio (generally containing more short-wavelength light) did improve detection ability but only at very low illuminance levels, below 0.6 lux.

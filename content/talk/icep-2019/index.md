abstract: Cycling has a range of health, environmental and economic benefits, prompting governments across the world to promote this mode of transport. Cycling should be a viable option at all times of the day, including after-dark. Previous research has demonstrated that darkness significantly reduces the number of people cycling. Outdoor lighting may encourage more people to cycle after-dark. Two sets of big data are used to assess the impact of lighting on cycling rates after-dark. Cycling frequencies are estimated using crowdsourced cycling trip data at a street level. These are compared against the presence and density of outdoor lighting on the streets and paths used by cyclists. An odds ratio method is used to quantify the relationship between lighting and cycling rates, accounting for other seasonal and time-of-day factors. Cycling trip data and lighting data were analysed for three cities in the UK (Glasgow, Newcastle and Sheffield). Odds ratios suggested the presence of lighting on a path or road increased cycling rates after-dark.Lighting is an important aspect of infrastructure that can encourage more cycling. Further work should identify optimal lighting characteristics to maximise cycling rates after-dark, and also investigate the effect of lighting on cyclist safety.
